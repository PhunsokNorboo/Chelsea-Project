# Session Notes: 2026-01-28

## What Was Done

### Fixtures & Results
- Fixed sort order: Results show newest first, Upcoming shows soonest first, All is chronological
- Added competition filtering

### Season Stats
- Converted to client component with tabs (All/PL/UCL)
- Added `getClScorers()` API function for Champions League data
- Combines PL and UCL scorers for "All" view

### Head-to-Head
- Fixed date display (was showing "Sun" instead of "25 Jan")
- Rewrote stats calculation to use actual match results instead of unreliable aggregates

### History Page Images
- Attempted: wsrv.nl proxy - FAILED (Wikipedia blocks)
- Attempted: Cloudinary fetch - FAILED (Wikipedia blocks)
- Solution: Downloaded images locally to `public/images/`
- Used Wikipedia API to find correct image URLs (original URLs were outdated/broken)
- 9 trophy images + 10 legend photos downloaded
- 5 legends use initials fallback (no free images available)

### Documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new components, API functions, image handling
- Created README.md for GitHub

## Commits Made
1. `ad6a7d6` - Add local images for history page, improve fixtures and season stats
2. `d5d7b2b` - Add comprehensive README

## Known Limitations
- football-data.org free tier: No goals in match lists, no FA Cup data
- Some legends (Harris, Osgood, Dixon, Greaves, Tambling) have no images

## Next Steps (When Resuming)
- Consider adding more features or polish
- Could add player stats page enhancements
- Could improve mobile responsiveness
- Could add more curated tweets
